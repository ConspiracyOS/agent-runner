# Mission

<!--
  This file defines the conspiracy's purpose. It is read by the strategist
  agent to produce operational policy. Keep it short — the strategist
  expands it into actionable priorities.

  This file is read-only for all agents (root-owned, outer config).
  Only the human director can update it.

No mission defined. This conspiracy is running in reactive mode.

To enable proactive operation, replace this file with your mission statement.
The strategist agent will read it and produce policy for the other agents
to follow.

Example:

  Maintain a personal website. Publish weekly blog posts from drafts
  in /srv/con/scopes/blog/drafts/. Monitor uptime. Keep costs under
  $50/month.
